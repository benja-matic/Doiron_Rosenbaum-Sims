# Doiron_Rosenbaum-Sims
My implementation of famous paper from Brent Doiron's lab https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27798630
I scaled down from 20000 neurons to 5000 for speed and because I ran longer simulations
I also used LIF neurons instead of conductance based integrate and fire neurons.
I used this network to study their system and investigate if it could explain psychophysical phenomena.
